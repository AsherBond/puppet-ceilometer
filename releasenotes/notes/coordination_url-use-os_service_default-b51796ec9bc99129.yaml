upgrade:
  - |
    The default value for the ``ceilometer::agent::polling::coordination_url``
    parameter has been changed from undef to $::os_service_default. Because
    of this change now the ``ceilometer::agent::polling`` class ensures that
    the ``coordination/backend_url`` parameter is unset by default.

deprecations:
  - |
    Usage of ``undef`` for the ``ceilometer::agent::polling::coordination_url``
    parameter has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release.
    Use ``$::os_service_default`` or any specific value instead.
